Suppose that this graph is stored with a **dense** representation with 1 bit per entry, then this would result in ~170 MB of storage space. If 8 bits (1 byte) are used per entry, then this would give us ~1.42 GB. Since PyTorch uses 64-bit floats (8 bytes) per entry, we would get more than 10 GB for this graph. This illustrates that even though many entries may be zero (meaning no edge) in this 37 700 x 37 700 matrix, a dense representation allocates space for all possible node pairs. However, in a **sparse** representation, instead of storing all possible entries, only the existing edges (nonzero entries) are stored, which  can significantly reduce the required space (if you do the math it's ~2.2 MB in this example) 😄"
